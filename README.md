# epl
Python code and Jupyter Notebooks for a pet project to predict football match results using various statistical models - both classical and ML

## Overview
Code consists of several main branches:
 - Database Creation/Maintenance: Code to create and regularly maintain an up to date sqlite database of European Football Matches pulled from [here](https://www.football-data.co.uk/)
 - Feature Creation/Maintenance: Code to take this raw match result data and create relevant features for use in predictive modelling
 - Modelling/Evaluation Helpers: Helper functions wrapped around standard libs (statsmodels, sklearn) to improve notebook workflow (e.g. pretty print confusion matrix using seaborn)

## Get Started
To run the code on your local machine from scratch:
1. Open your cmd line and go to where you want to install e.g. to install like below go to dev as parent directory:
```
/User/username/dev/
               project1/
               project2/
               epl/
```
2.
